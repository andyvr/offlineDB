offlineDB
=========

offlineDB is a simple multi-purpose record managing system set as the single HTML file with ability to edit and save data offline.

Currently I'm hosting on the Github only the assembled version of the app. Source files with Angularjs logic, html and css files as well as the assembly scripts will be added later. However they are not needed to use the app.

You can find more details on how to use it here: http://andyvr.github.io/offlineDB
